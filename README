BarnOwl-Module-ClassFilters

Loads filters out of ~/.owl/classfilters.

Filters are or'd by line and and'd within a line.  Lines may be provided in
a modified form of standard .zephyr.subs class,instance,recipient triplet 
syntax.  Any missing fields at the end of the triplet are assumed to be 
wildcards.  Lines beginning with open-parens are passed through raw.

A sample file ~/.owl/classfilters/testfilter:

dirty-owl-hackers
sipb
message,white-magic
kevinr,status,kevinr
barnowl,*,*
*,personal,*
*,*,kevinr
( filter personal )

results in the following filter 'testfilter':

filter testfilter ( class ^(un)?dirty-owl-hackers$ ) or ( class ^(un)?sipb$ ) \
    or ( class ^(un)?message$ and instance ^(un)?white-magic$ ) \
    or ( class ^(un)?kevinr$ and instance ^(un)?status$ and recipient ^kevinr$ ) \
    or ( class ^(un)?barnowl$ ) or ( instance ^(un)?personal$ ) \
    or ( recipient ^kevinr$ ) or ( filter personal )
